# CS-360_Course
Portfolio for SNHU's CS-360 Mobile Architect &amp; Programming, taken July - August 2023, focused on learning Mobile Application Development with Android Studio, Java, and XML.

_Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?_
  
  This project was an inventory control application, with requirements to: a SQL database with a table for inventory items and another for storing user login date, multiple screens including one for login and one to display items, mechanisms to manage items including adding, subtracting, and removing items.
    
_What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?_
  
  The application uses several screens. This includes a login screen, an inventory view, a settings and notifications screen, and an item management screen. When laying out the application, keeping user intentions in mind was the top priority. Every screen makes it clear where the user is within the app and lays out application features in a clear, concise manner.

_How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?_
  
  Researching and looking at similar applications was my first step in coding the application. While reviewing the information within our weekly Zybooks chapter helped me understand specific code, additional research helped me understand both best coding practices, as well as how others coded features similar to my intended features.
  
_How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?_
  
  I performed manual testing of the code on multiple devices on both emulated and physical devices. I tested that the code performed as intended and attempted to "break" the application by performing actions in unintended ways. This allowed me to understand how certain code operated and the limits of features.

_Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?_
  
  The biggest thing I struggled with was tying the different features together. By reviewing the Zybooks and reading through some additional online tutorials I was able to tie the features together in a way that made holistic sense.

_In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?_
  
  Dipping my toes into SQL was a challenging and interesting aspect of the application for me. I intend to spend some additional time further exploring SQL, as I feel a barely scratched the surface with its use here, but it opened a new avenue of software development for me. I also enjoyed exploring the Android Studio IDE and learning more about Android itself.
